# JAWS Progress Report — 2026-01-04 (last 24h)

## Completed
- Updated the homepage hero content with CTA highlights and dual contact actions to surface the value proposition early (phone + email paths).
- Enhanced the underwater hero scene with additive water shaders, ocean-floor depth, caustics, floating particles, and a new `box_aquarium.glb` model fade-in for a richer 3D impression.
- Added a `lint` script (`next lint`) in `package.json` to keep the Next.js app lintable via `npm run lint`.

## Status — Hero Element
- Design is ~50% complete. Visual structure and CTAs are in place, but readability/spacing and CTA wording still need refinement.
- Needs a smoother transition cue from hero to the next section (scroll/chevron/swipe) so progression feels natural.

## Open Issues / Risks
- Readability: subtitle + CTA copy are dense; needs a pass for brevity and clarity while keeping contrast accessible.
- CTA verbage: align tone between “Schedule a Consultation” and “Email a Design Packet”; confirm final phone/email targets.
- Section transitions: add a natural scroll or swipe cue between hero → services; consider scroll-snap or a down-arrow anchor.
- Lower-page copy/layout: tighten wording and spacing in the Why Us and Contact sections; verify mobile stacking and line lengths.

## Notes on Recent Design Work
- Hero: headline/tagline + CTA pills and dual buttons now live; typography and spacing still to be tuned for smaller viewports.
- Water FX: new additive water/caustic shaders, ocean-floor shader, environment light tweaks, and GLB material fade-in for depth.
- Contact: CTA button links to tel; testimonials slider unchanged; overall style remains consistent with existing palette.

## Next Steps (suggested)
1) Copy/edit pass on hero subtitle and CTAs for readability and tone.
2) Add a scroll cue/transition (chevron, scroll-snap, or swipe hint) between hero and services.
3) Adjust spacing and layout in lower sections to improve readability and mobile fit.
4) Run `npm run lint` and a quick accessibility/contrast check after copy/layout tweaks.

## Open Questions
- Preferred interaction for section transitions: scroll-snap vs. a chevron jump vs. swipe hint?
- Any brand voice or terminology guidelines for the CTA wording and lower-page copy?
